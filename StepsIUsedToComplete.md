<!-- STEPS I USED 
install react.js
install react packages
create my route pages
create my nav bars - use react to make all of these into components
create a component folder, make a NavBar file under that
create my navbar styles CSS for my razzle dazzle
i then need to link words to each navigation
start styling my nav: so give my uL in Navbars a classname then target it in navbarstyles.css
